/**
 * ADD SCHOOLS PAGE - School Management Interface
 * 
 * CHANGES MADE:
 * - Converted from basic HTML layout to professional Ant Design components
 * - Added professional header with icon and descriptive text
 * - Implemented clean card-based layout with proper spacing
 * - Added responsive design with centered content
 * - Integrated Schools component with proper context
 * 
 * BACKEND INTEGRATION NEEDED:
 * - Add school statistics display (total schools, active schools, etc.)
 * - Implement school search and filtering functionality
 * - Add bulk school import/export capabilities
 * - Include school status management (active, inactive, pending)
 * - Add school performance analytics and reporting
 * 
 * SUPABASE INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Schools Statistics: SELECT COUNT(*) as total, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active FROM schools
 * - Recent Schools: SELECT * FROM schools ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5
 * - School Analytics: Complex queries for enrollment, performance, etc.
